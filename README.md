In this repo, we have notebooks to fine tune three LLMs (Flan T5-base, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, and BART) to generate comedic punchlines based on an inputted joke starter.
Files tuneT5, tuneMistral, and tuneBart are notebooks that showcase how we utilized PEFT to tune them on the RedditJokesDataset.
